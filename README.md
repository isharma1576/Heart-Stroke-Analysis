# Heat-Stroke-Analysis
Heart stroke, a critical medical condition, demands thorough analysis for better understanding and prevention. Leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, this project aims to analyze heart stroke data for a sample size of 5,100 patients. By utilizing Power BI's advanced data visualization and analytical tools, we can uncover key insights into the factors influencing heart stroke occurrences and outcomes.

Objectives of the Analysis:

1. Identify Risk Factors: Determine the primary risk factors contributing to heart strokes, such as age, lifestyle, medical history, and demographics.

2. Patient Demographics: Analyze the demographic distribution of patients affected by heart strokes, including age, gender, and geographic location.

3. Health Indicators: Examine health indicators like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI), and pre-existing conditions.

4. Outcomes and Trends: Assess the outcomes of heart stroke incidents and identify any observable trends or patterns over time.

5. Predictive Insights: Develop predictive models to forecast potential heart stroke risks in the patient population.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection and Preparation: Import and clean the dataset of 5,100 patients using Power Query in Power BI. This involves handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and standardizing data formats.

2. Data Transformation: Shape and transform the data to create a comprehensive dataset suitable for analysis. This includes filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.

3. Visualization and Analysis: Utilize Power BI's visualization tools to create interactive dashboards and reports. These visualizations will help in exploring the relationships between various factors and heart-stroke occurrences.

4. Insight Generation: Interpret the visualized data to generate actionable insights and recommendations for healthcare practitioners and policymakers.

By conducting this heart stroke analysis, we aim to contribute valuable insights that can aid in the early detection and prevention of heart strokes, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the overall incidence of this critical health condition.
